    + Create [With this you can create tables]

        CREATE TABLE table_name (
            column1 datatype,
            column2 datatype,
            ...
            PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2)
        );

    + you can view all the tables for a user

        SELECT table_name FROM user_tables;
        SELECT table_name FROM dba_tables; // for all the tables on the dba

    + See the structure 
        DESCRIBE student_table;
    

    + You can insert data - 
    
        INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Alice', 95);

>To alter the table 
    ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;
