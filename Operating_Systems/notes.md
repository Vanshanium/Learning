## Types of Operating Systems

### 1. Batch Operating Systems

    <img src="./Assets/Batch.webp" alt="History" style="width: 60%; border-radius: 10px;">
</div>

This is used in the Third Generation Computers. 
- The System works in Batches (Compilation of same tasks)
- They where not Real-Time (No real time user Interaction)
- Used In First Generation Computers.
- **Ex** : IBMâ€™s OS/360

### 2. Time-Sharing (Multi-Tasking) Operating Systems

</div>

This is used in the Second Generation Computers, when Batch became slow and CPU have to sit idle. 

- In this, Users shares the **single** CPU and then it works as a Round Robin with a shared time called **Time Slice** or **Quantum**
- High Overhead (Use of Resources) and can Have Security vulnerabilites with memory leaks 
- **Ex** : Unix, Windows NT

### 3. Multi-Processing

</div>

This is used in the Fourth Generation Computers, Where we can have multiple processors and they can run multi tasks aswell.
- In this User have multiple Processor and work can be parallized and can be done by any of them. 
    - Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)
    - Asymmetric Multiprocessing (ASMP)
- **Ex** : Linux, Windows 95, MacOS and all new OS
